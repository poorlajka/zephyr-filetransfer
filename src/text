Almost all of the related work found is focused on solutions for implementing enterprise architecture in an agile way or how to make the architecture more agile.
Armour & Kaisler present how to do agile enterprise architecture transition and implementation [8]. While, Lankhorst list and discuss potential problems, such as the ivory tower syndrome or IKIWISI syndrome (‘I’ll know it when I see it’), in agile service development [9]. Hensema found partial evidence that current EA development adheres to waterfall principles and, like software development, might benefit from agile principles [10]. Blomqvist et al. find in their study a strengthening of the view that EA is still mainly a tool for translating the strategy into actions and thus provide the most value in the implementation phase [11]. Bente et al. focus on how to apply agile and lean methods in EA [12]. The focus on this type of combination between agile and EA, that is how to work agile with architecture, are many incl. e.g. [13]-[19].
The other large field in agile and EA is with focus on the systems modeled using enterprise architecture. Here there are two approaches dominating; 1) using probabilistic enterprise architecture modeling and analysis [20] for modifiability/maintainability/agility assessment see e.g. [21]- [23], and 2) employing the hidden structure method [24] for modularity/complexity/agility assessment and visualization see e.g. [25]-[28].
We have only found one other source aiming to answer a question similar to ours, namely “How can enterprise architects collaborate with agile software development teams?” in Integrating Agile Software Development and Enterprise Architecture Management by Hanschke et al. [29]. They gathered data through interviews as well, with interviewees from a consultancy firm, a railway company, and an automotive OEM. The authors focused on Scrum and the results of the paper focuses on the necessary collaboration of empowered implementation teams with a central EA function.
Our study complement the findings in [29] using a similar approach but with new companies and interviewees. Thus, adding more information to a field that is fairly unexplored at the moment.
